About SALOME LIGHT sample
*************************

SALOME LIGHT module presents example of a simple SALOME module, implemented
with C++, without CORBA-engine; such type of module is called "light" in SALOME.
This sample demonstrates a way to create a modules which have only GUI library
but nevertheless can be integrated into SALOME platform.

This sample module is a simple text file reader. Each empty line read from the
file is presented in the data tree as the beginning of new paragraph; paragraph
can be empty. Non-empty line presents a "leaf" in the data tree.

Thus, the data tree hierarchy has tree levels:

Root
  |__ Paragraph
  |        |____ Text line
  |        |____ Text line
  |        |____ ...
  |__ Paragraph
  |__ Paragraph
  |        |____ Text line
  |        |____ ...
  |__ ...

============
Installation
============

--------------
Pre-requisites
--------------

SALOME platform relies on a set of third-party softwares; some of them are needed
at build time only, while other ones are needed in runtime also.

For more information about the pre-requisites please visit SALOME platform web
site:

* Check Release Notes and Software Requirements of the latest SALOME release at

  <http://www.salome-platform.org/downloads/current-version/>

* Pre-requisites page at SALOME web site:

  <http://www.salome-platform.org/downloads/license/>

Note: SALOME LIGHT needs SALOME KERNEL and SALOME GUI as pre-requisites.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

The build procedure of the SALOME platform is implemented with CMake.
In order to build the module you have to do the following actions:

1. Set up environment for pre-requisites (see "Pre-requisites" section above).

2. Create a build directory:

   % mkdir LIGHT_BUILD

3. Configure the build procedure:

   % cd LIGHT_BUILD
   % cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<mode> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_directory> <path_to_src_dir>

   where
   - <mode> is either Release or Debug (default: Release);
   - <installation_directory> is a destination folder to install SALOME LIGHT
     module (default: /usr);
   - <path_to_src_dir> is a path to the SALOME LIGHT sources directory.

   Note: by default (if CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option is not given), SALOME LIGHT
   module will be configured for installation to the /usr directory that requires
   root permissions to complete the installation.

4. Build and install:

   % make
   % make install

   This will install SALOME LIGHT module to the <installation_directory>
   specified to cmake command on the previous step.

-------------------
Custom installation
-------------------

SALOME LIGHT module supports a set of advanced configuration options;
for more details learn CMakeLists.txt file in the root source directory.

You can also use other options of cmake command to customize your installation.
Learn more about available options by typing

   % cmake --help

=============
Functionality
=============

The module functionality includes the following user actions:

* "File" menu:

  - "Load text file"       : reads and loads the contents of text file to the
                             data model; the previous contents of data model
                             is erased.

  - "Save text file"       : dumps the contents of the data model to the text
                             file.

* "LIGHT" menu:

  - "Edit selected line"   : allows user to edit the selected text line.

  - "Insert new text line" : inserts the new text line entered by the user before
                             the selected one; if there is no selection, new line
                             is added to the end of the data tree.

  - "Remove line"          : removes the selected line.

  - "Clear all"            : clears all the contents of the data model.


Most of these actions change the contents of the internal data model, so the data
tree is rebuilt correspondingly.
Some of these commands are also avaiable via the context popup menu in the Object
Browser.

Saving/restoring of the data is performed by using of default SALOMEDS-based
persistence mechanism provided by SALOME GUI via embedded SalomeApp engine.

Note: after opening of the sudy file the LIGHT module data is not
immediately displayed in the Object Browser. To see it, you should activate the
module. Such behaviour takes place because the LIGHT module does not publish any
data directly in the SALOMEDS study - this is typical behavior of any "lighy"
SALOME module, imposed by limitation of SALOME platform.

=====
Usage
=====

Run SALOME with LIGHT module:

- In full, CORBA-based session:

runSalome --modules=LIGHT

- In "light" session:

runLightSalome.sh --modules=LIGHT
