\mainpage Introduction to HYBRIDPLUGIN

\b HYBRIDPLUGIN plugin is designed for:
- Meshing 3D geometric closed entities: volumes are split into tetrahedra, 
pyramids, prisms and hexahedra elements.
- Generating 3D meshes from 2D meshes of a wrap (triangles and quadrangles), 
working with geometrical objects for setting and meshing layers.

\note HYBRIDPLUGIN plugin used MeshGems-Hybrid commercial mesher and require a 
license to be used within the Mesh module.

To manage parameters of the HYBRIDPLUGIN use \subpage hybrid_hypo_page and \subpage additional_hypo_page

Also all HYBRIDPLUGIN functionalities are accessible via
\subpage hybridplugin_python_interface_page "HYBRIDPLUGIN Python interface".
