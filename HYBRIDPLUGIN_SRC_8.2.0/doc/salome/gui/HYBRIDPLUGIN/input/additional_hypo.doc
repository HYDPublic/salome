\page additional_hypo_page Layers Meshes

\n <b>Layers Meshes</b> be used to set layers mesh generation.

<li>
This hypothesis allows creation of layers of highly stretched hexahedra, prisms, and tetrahedra) near
mesh boundary (onto the wrap), which is beneficial for high quality viscous
computations. The elements constructed on the layer mesh faces are
actually hexahedra and prisms and tetraheda.
</li>

For more detailed description of the this additional hypothesis please refer Distene MG-hybrid User's Guide
(not yet!, waiting for first official release).
