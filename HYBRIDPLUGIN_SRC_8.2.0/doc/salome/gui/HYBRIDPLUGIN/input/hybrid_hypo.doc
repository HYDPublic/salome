  -h --help
          prints this help.

  -v --verbose <verbose>
          Sets the verbosity level parameter.
          The <verbose> parameter must be in the range 0 to 10:
            0 : no detail
            10 : very detailed
          Default: 3

  -i --in <filein>
          Sets the input file.
          (MANDATORY)

  -o --out <fileout>
          Sets the output file.
          If unset, _hybrid is appended to the input file basename.
          Using an existing file is forbidden.
          Using the same file as --in is forbidden.

     --global_physical_size <size>
          Sets the global physical size.
          Default: no default.

     --max_number_of_threads <maxthreads>
          Sets the maximum number of threads to be used in parallel.
          Default: 4

     --boundary_layer_size_mode <mode>
          Sets the behavior for the boundary layer sizes.
          If <mode> is:
            global: the boundary_layer_global_initial_height is used to compute
             the layer heights
            local: the boundary_layer_surface_tags and
             boundary_layer_initial_height_on_surface_tags are used to compute
             the layer heights
          Default: global

     --number_of_boundary_layers <number>
          Sets the number of boundary layers.
          Default: 0

     --boundary_layer_global_initial_height <height>
          Sets the height of the first layer.

     --boundary_layer_surface_tags <list>
          Comma separated list of surface references to be used to grow
          boundary layers.

     --boundary_layer_initial_height_on_surface_tags <list>
          Comma separated list of initial heights to be used to grow boundary
          layers.

     --boundary_layer_imprint_tags <list>
          Comma separated list of surface references that are imprinted by
          boundary layers.

     --boundary_layer_geometric_progression <real>
          Sets the geometric progression for all the boundary layer growths
          (position of layer number i is h * g^(i-1)).
          Default: 1.0

     --boundary_layer_max_element_angle <size>
          Sets the maximum internal angles of elements (in degree). This
          setting applies to the boundary layer elements only.
          Default: 165.

     --normal_direction <dir>
          Specifies whether mg-hybrid should use the surface normals or the
          inverse of the surface normals.
          if <dir> is:
             1 : means the layers grow in the same direction as the normals to
             the surface
            -1 : means the layers grow in the opposite direction to the normals
             of the surface
          Default: 1

     --gradation <real>

          Sets the element type for the mesh generation.
          If <type> is:
            tetra_dominant : prismatic or hexahedral elements in the boundary
             layers, tetrahedra in the remaining volume
            hexa_dominant : prismatic or hexahedral elements in the boundary
             layers, mixture of hexahedra and tetrahedra in the remaining
             volume
            cartesian_core : cartesian hexa core with tetrahedra and pyramids
             in the remaining volume
            extrusion_only : only prismatic or hexahedral elements near the
             boundary are generated. The remaining volume is not filled.
          Default: tetra_dominant

     --collision_mode <mode>
          Sets the behavior in case of collision between layers.
          If <mode> is:
            decrease : keeps the number of desired layer but decreases the
             height of the layers to avoid any collision
            stop : stops locally the generation of layers to avoid collisions;
             the number of generated layers may differ from the specified
             desired number
          Default: stop

     --add_multinormals <yes|no>
          Add extra normals at opening ridges and corners.
          Default: no

     --multinormal_angle_threshold <angle>
          Set the maximum angle between the multiple normals at opening ridges.
          Default: 30

     --smooth_normals <yes|no>
          Smooth normals at closed ridges and corners.
          Default: no

     --optimisation <type>
          sets the optimisation type.
          If <type> is:
              no : no optimisation is applied
             yes : optimisation is performed upon mesh generation 
            only : only optimisation is performed to an existing volume mesh.
          Default: yes.

- <b>Limitations</b> - Some of the MG-Hybrid parameters can not be changed in SALOME and are set to their default values. The parameters concerned are the following : global_physical_size, boundary_layer_size_mode, boundary_layer_initial_height_on_surface_tags, boundary_layer_max_element_angle and optimisation.

\subsection log Logs and debug

- <b>Working directory</b> - allows defining the folder for input and output
files of hybrid software, which are the files starting with "HYBRID_" prefix.

- <b>Verbose level</b> - to choose verbosity level in the range from
0 to 10.

  - 0, no standard output,

  - 2, prints the data, quality statistics of the skin and final
  meshes and indicates when the final mesh is being saved. In addition
  the software gives indication regarding the CPU time.

  - 10, same as 2 plus the main steps in the computation, quality
  statistics histogram of the skin mesh, quality statistics histogram
  together with the characteristics of the final mesh.
  
- <b>Print log in a file</b> - if this option is checked on the log is printed in a 
file placed in the working directory, otherwise it is printed on the standard output.

- <b>Remove log on success</b> - if this option is checked on the log file is kept only
if an error occurs during the computation. This option is only available if <b>Print log in a file</b>
is enabled (there must be a log file to delete it) and <b>Keep all working files</b> is disabled 
(in this case the log file is always kept). 

- <b>Keep all working files</b> - allows checking input and output files
of hybrid software, while usually these files are removed after the
launch of the mesher. The log file (if any) is also kept if this option is checked.

\subsection advanced_meshing_options Advanced meshing options

- A table allows to input in the command line any text
for hybrid argument from "mg-hybrid.exe help", and future advanced options... <br> 
<b>Add option</b> - adds a line to the table where you can type an option and its value as text.
A check box in the first column activates/deactivates the option of the current row. A deactivated option will be erased upon pressing \a Ok.

\section hybrid_layers_meshes Layers meshes

\image html hybrid_hypothesis_layers.png

HYBRID algorithm mesh layers on groups of faces. If <b>Mesh layers on all wrap</b>
is checked, all wrap is meshed as layers (as boundary_layers_surface_ids 5), else
only submeshes selected an added are meshed as layers (as boundary_layers_surface_ids 6).
Pay attention: theses groups should be defined
into the shell mesh from a previous group defined in the geometry.
