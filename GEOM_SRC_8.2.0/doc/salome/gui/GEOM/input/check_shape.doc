<UL>

<LI>
<em>geompy.CheckShape(theShape, theIsCheckGeom = 0, theReturnStatus = 0),</em> \n
where \n
\em theShape is the shape checked for validity. \n
\em theIsCheckGeom is the flag that tells if geometry should be checked also.\n
\em theReturnStatus is the flag that can have the following values:
<UL>
<LI>0 - if theShape is invalid, a description of problem is printed.
\em IsValid status is returned.</LI>
<LI>1 - \em IsValid status and the description of problem are returned.</LI>
<LI>2 - \em IsValid status and the list of error data are returned.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>

<LI>
<em>geompy.PrintShapeErrors(self, theShape, theShapeErrors, theReturnStatus = 0),</em> \n
where \n
\em theShape is the shape checked for validity. \n
\em theShapeErrors are the shape errors obtained by CheckShape. \n
\em theReturnStatus is the flag that can have the following values:
<UL>
<LI>0 - the problem description is printed and \em IsValid status is returned.</LI>
<LI>1 - the problem description is returned.</LI>
