\page manipulate_object Manipulate GEOM object in the study (module geomtools)

The Python module <a href="geompy_doc/group__geomtools.html">geomtools</a> provides
utility functions to handle %GEOM items in SALOME study:
- add or remove a shape;
- display or erase a shape in the viewer;
- completely delete a shape (undisplay, unpublish, and destroy it);
- manage the selection in the object browser

The usage of <em>geomtools</em> module can be tested with the following set of instructions:

\code
from salome.geom.geomtools import TEST_createAndDeleteShape
TEST_createAndDeleteShape()
\endcode

This test executes the following procedure:
- Create, publish, and display a cylinder;
- Create, publish, and display a sphere;
- Create a box, publish it in a folder <em>boxset</em>, and display it in <em>pink</em> color.
- Erase the sphere from the viewer (the sphere still exists in the study)
- Delete the cylinder. It is no longer displayed and does not exist any more in the study or in the GEOM component.

At outcome of the test execution, the following objects appear in the SALOME session:
- The box located in a dedicated study folder and displayed in the viewer;
- The sphere in the standard place of the study, and not displayed.
