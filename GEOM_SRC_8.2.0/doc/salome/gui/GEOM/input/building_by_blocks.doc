\page build_by_blocks_page Building by blocks

A block is a an elementary geometric solid that has specific
geometric constraints oriented for meshing. 
- Tetrahedral Block - is a block with constraints for tetrahedral
meshing. It has 4 faces and 3 edges on each face. 
- Hexahedral Block - is a block with constraints for hexahedral meshing. 
It has 6 faces and each 4 edges on each face.
- Block Compound - is a compound composed of blocks only.

The functionalities that allow building blocks are available from the main menu via <b>New
Entity / Blocks</b> item.
