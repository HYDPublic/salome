\n To produce a <b>Multi Rotation</b> in the <b>Main Menu</b> select
<b>Operations - > Transformation - > Multi Rotation</b>

\n This operation creates a compound of several rotated shapes basing on the initial shape.


In case of  <b>Simple Multi Rotation</b> the object is multiplied by rotation.

The following parameters and options can be defined in this dialog:
- <b>Result Name</b>;
- <b> Main Object </b> to be rotated;
- \b Vector defines the axis of rotation (DZ by default);
- <b>Angular step</b> is the angle by which the object is rotated. By default 
(if the checkbox is not checked), it is 2 * \a PI / \a NbTimes;
- <b>Nb. Times</b> is the number of rotated shape copies in the resulting compound. If \a NbTimes = 1, the result contains only the
initial shape;
- \ref restore_presentation_parameters_page "Advanced options".

\n The \b Result will be a \b GEOM_Object (compound).

\n <b>TUI Commands:</b>
\n <em>geompy.MultiRotate1DNbTimes(Shape, Axis, NbTimes)</em>
\n <em>geompy.MultiRotate1DByStep(Shape, Axis, AngleStep, NbTimes)</em>

\b <b>NB!</b> There is another way to execute a Multi-rotation
operation, which is currently accessible only via TUI commands:
<em>geompy.MakeMultiRotation1DNbTimes(Shape, Dir, Point, NbTimes)</em>,
<em>geompy.MakeMultiRotation1DByStep(Shape, Dir, Point, AngleStep, NbTimes)</em>,
which works in the same way, but the Axis is defined by direction and point.

In case of  <b>Double Multi Rotation</b> the object is multiplied by rotation and additionally translated several times in each direction.

The following parameters and options can be defined in this dialog:
- <b>Result Name</b>;
- <b> Main Object </b> to be rotated;
- \b Vector defines the axis of rotation (DZ by default);
- <b>Angular step</b> is the angle by which the object is rotated. By default 
(if the checkbox is not checked), it is 2 * \a PI / \a NbTimes;
- <b>Nb. Times</b> (\a NbTimes1) is the number of rotated shape copies in the resulting compound;
- \b Reverse checkbox allows changing the direction of translation;
- <b> Radial step </b> is the distance between the shape copies in the same direction. Translation direction passes through the center of gravity of the
initial shape and its projection on the rotation axis;
- <b>Nb. Times</b> (\a NbTimes2) is the number of shape copies in the same direction. If \a NbTimes2 = 1, the result is the same as for <b>Simple Multi Rotation</b>. If both \a NbTimes1 and \a NbTimes2 are equal to 1, the result will contain only the initial non-transformed shape;
- \ref restore_presentation_parameters_page "Advanced options".

\n <b>TUI Commands:</b>
\n <em>geompy.MultiRotate2DNbTimes(Shape, Axis, NbTimes1, RadialStep, NbTimes2)</em>
\n <em>geompy.MultiRotate2DByStep(Shape, Axis, AngleStep, NbTimes1, RadialStep, NbTimes2)</em>

<b>NB!</b> There is another way to execute a Double Multi-rotation
operation, which is currently accessible only via TUI commands: 
<em>geompy.MakeMultiRotation2DNbTimes(Shape, Dir, Point, NbTimes1, RadialStep, NbTimes2)</em>,
<em>geompy.MakeMultiRotation2DByStep(Shape, Dir, Point, AngleStep, NbTimes1, RadialStep, NbTimes2)</em>,
which works in the same way, but the Axis is defined by direction and point.
